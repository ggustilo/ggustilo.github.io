		<p>My wireframe was very simples, so translating it into HTML was not super difficult. Some of the HTML5 tags were new to me: section, aside, nav, and article. I think they're a really great idea, though, because the div tag was way overworked. HTML5, in general, seems like a very good upgrade to HTML4.</p>

		<p>I am very excited to start incorporating my design next week. My website relies heavily on colors and fonts, so I think it will be a big improvement.</p>

		<p>I am still struggling with the relative links. :/</p>

<!-- 
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ? 

Wireframing with a pair was kind of weird, but it was interesting to view someone else's creative process, and I got a couple of good ideas from them.  Doing the HTML together was also somewhat helpful.  Although our wireframes looked pretty different, and we did the HTML pretty separately, we exchanged some good tips and tricks.  Overall, a good experience.

I love wireframing.  I'm more of a 'quick and dirty' wireframer; although I admire people who take it to another level, and make it really artistic, it's just a quick communication tool for me most of the time.  Unless I'm doing it for a client, in which case I will try to produce something a bit more polished.

My pair and I produced very different wireframes, but we came to a mutual conclusion that the wireframe should indicate the main pieces of content and how they are laid-out, without getting into too much detail.

I used the article and nav tags for the first time, and learned about the address tag as well. Pretty cool.
