			<p>Overall, the experience of building this website from scratch has been very positive.  It was gratifying to know that I could achieve my own vision for the site without too much help or extra tools.  In general, I think the site is not as polished or slick-looking as the one I created with Squarespace, but it does accurately represent my wireframes.</p>

			<p>I think the most difficult thing about building a personal website is planning for it - knowing what you want up front and not compromising those desires when it becomes tough to implement.  Working through the bugs and learning how to use new tools is how you grow the most as a developer.  Of course, CSS gave me some trouble, and I'm still not entirely satisfied with how the design turned out, but I learned a great deal.</p>

			<p>The most positive aspect of building the site was gaining the confidence and knowledge that I am capable of doing it - that I can work through the issues and at the end of the day, I've built something from nothing.</p>
