<p>First, let me begin by saying that I really enjoyed Shereef's Fireside Chat. I wasn't planning on watching the whole thing, but I stayed entranced all the way through. And! - the Q&A section was actually really informative: a good mix of questions about the curriculum, job prospects, what it means to be a developer, and Dev Bootcamp itself.</p>

<p>Overall, I thought the video gave a good impression of Dev Bootcamp's spirit, mentality....and 'feel,' for lack of a better word. Although it might give some people pause, I was not at all turned off by the knowledge that Dev Bootcamp is still very much a work in progress - an experiment, as Shereef said. In fact, I think better of it, knowing that it is not stuck in place, not coagulated into some dry curriculum, but changes and evolves over time. That is exactly the kind of attitude I expect from the tech industry.</p>

<p>That said, I was not really surprised by the video at all. Making the decision to switch careers and invest in Dev Bootcamp was a long time coming for me. I did a lot of research into the tech industry and the kinds of companies/attitudes/people that I could expect to find there. I tried a number of different online programs and courses, like CodeAcademy, Treehouse, Code School, Harvard's CS50, to see if the work was something I would enjoy.</p>

<p>My dad is a career software engineer in New York. My brother is a self-taught computer engineer and Bitcoin enthusiast. My best friend's long-time boyfriend works for Microsoft (actually, just quit to open a startup in San Francisco). Another friend works for ThoughtWorks - where I actually applied once upon a time (and if you don't know about their interview process, let me just say 'whew!'). I grilled all of them about their experiences and recommendations, picking their brains about the state of the industry, their work culture, the work itself, and my suitability for such a career.</p>

<p>I also worked as a web designer and sudo(not that sudo)-developer for three years on the side, familiarizing myself with Wordpress, Ghost, Squarespace, Webhook, etc. And then, once I decided to pursue web development seriously, I did a lot of research into the different bootcamp programs available.</p>

<p>Long story short - it took me two years to apply to Dev Bootcamp, and by the time I did, I had a pretty good idea about what I was getting into. Dev Bootcamp has a reputation for rigorous education and for having the type of culture that assimilates well into the creme de la creme of the tech world. That is what I expected. That is what I was looking for.</p>

<p>And the DIY mindset? Well, let's just say that, as someone who was homeschooled and classically educated from 7 to 18 by a born scholar (my mother, one of the most brilliant and organizationally-challenged women I've ever met), I am very familiar with being thrown in the deep end and forced to swim. I thrive under such circumstances, and amongst people with similar thinking. That is why I am drawn to the tech world - where people are not afraid to take control, get their hands dirty, and build what they want to see in the world. So...anyway, I'm really looking forward to DBC Phase 1.</p>
