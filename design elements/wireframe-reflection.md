#Wireframe Reflection

Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp
U1.W2. Wireframes Reflection

##Prompt:

What is a wireframe?
What are the benefits of wireframing?
Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

##Reflection:

A wireframe is a sketch or schematic of a website or web application.  They are not supposed to give you a high-fidelity representation of what the application will look like.  Instead, they are helpful for producing quick visualizations of ideas.

I find wireframing very useful for expressing ideas.  I always enjoy using them to try and figure out how I wanted something to work.  I revised my wireframe a couple of times.

Questions I always ask when wireframing: What is the goal of this site or application? What is the most important information to convey? What is the second most important information to convey? How will a user find what they are looking for when they come to my site?  I like using paper and pen when doing things myself.  If I am recreating wireframes for a client, I will use Balsamiq or another more polished wireframing tool.  I also really liked <a href="http://wireframes.tumblr.com/">I <3 Heart Wireframes</a>.  Wireframes can definitely be a bit of an art unto themselves, even though I tend to use them in a 'quick and dirty' fashion.

To be honest, I found this challenge as a whole a bit tedious.  Don't get me wrong, wireframes are incredibly useful and I definitely understand why this is a challenge.  Also, practicing my git and GitHub skills is always good.  However, wireframing is not new to me, and I actually just finished my own personal website (and tech blog) before DBC started so this was a bit like <em>deja vu</em>.  Still, on the positive side, I meant to do my own website from scratch before (and ended up doing it in SquareSpace), so this will give me the opportunity to build it my own way fresh from the beginning!
