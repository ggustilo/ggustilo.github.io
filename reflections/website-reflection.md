##Prompt:

What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
What did you learn about CSS positioning?
What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

##Reflection:

I learned all about CSS padding, borders and margins by doing this challenge.  Padding is the space between the content and the border; the border is...well the border around the content; and margins are the area around your element.  In particular, I learned that you have to account for margins 'stacking up' once you have multiple elements on the page if you don't watch your positioning.

Positioning is ESSENTIAL for getting your webpage to look right.  Making sure that you're working in the context you think you are makes debugging so much easier.  I find that absolute positioning is my friend.

The easiest design elements to implement were by far the ones relating to font color, size, and decoration - text formatting so to speak.  The positioning and margins were the hardest to debug.  Also, the gradient was pretty challenging, and I had to seek out an online tool for help.

When adding and formatting elements in CSS, make sure you are closing all your tags (there were a couple of really weird bugs that I finally figured out were just unclosed tags) and your class names match the CSS selectors (I need to firmly implement either a dash or underscore standard for myself - it just got out of control).  Also, make sure you know which elements are inside other elements and anticipate how that will effect your formatting.  AND USE THE DEV TOOLS! :)
